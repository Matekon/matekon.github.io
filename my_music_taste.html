<h1 style="text-align: center;">My music taste</h1>

<p>I don’t think quality depends on the musical style, a piece is good regardless of it. It mainly depends on the composer(s) I think.</p>

<p>But I am also quite aware that I do have quite clear musical preferences. I tend to like music that is contemplative, intimate, a bit weird, rich in texture and homogeneous in its structure, and with colorful harmonies (wide use of extensions). </p>

<p>As my favorite composer, depending on the day and my mood, I would either say Steve Reich or Morton Feldman. </p>

<p>I listened to a lot of minimalists and I still think Steve Reich is my favorite among all of them, mainly because I think he has emotions in his harmonies that others quite don’t reach. My favorite pieces of him would be “Eight Lines”, "Music for a Large Ensemble" and "Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ". </p>

<p>If someone told me that atonal music cannot be emotional, as a first reflex, I would tell them to listen to Morton Feldman, specifically the pieces of his last 10 years. He can make you say “fuck yeah” to obscure non-diatonic harmonies. His music also fits well with my "Optimistic Nihilistic" view of life. It makes me feel an existential void, but serene and contemplative instead of agonizing.  My favorite piece of him would be “Piano and String Quartet”, but his "String Quartet no.2" comes pretty close. </p>

<p>I enjoy analysing James Tenney, Tom Johnson and Arvo Pärt because of their “procedural” or "algorithmic" approach to music. </p>

<p>I am not a huge fan of romantic or classical music, with the notable exception of Beethoven’s four last string quartets.</p>

<p>I enjoy Bach very much, especially his pieces in the form of the ritornello, like the first movement of his fifth Brandenburg concerto, which I find to be a masterpiece of structure. </p>
