        <h1> A mathematical analysis of Frederic Rzewski's <i>Coming Together</i> </h1>

        This is the starting point of the piece, or the "seed". Its consists of 7 notes ascending the G minor pentatonic scale. <br><br>
        <img src="img/Seed.png"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Seed.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

        From this, let's create the pattern A, by first taking the first note of the seed, then the first 2 notes, then the first 3 notes etc. until we get all 7 notes.<br><br>

        <img src="img/Pattern A.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern A.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

        Let's notice the process we've just done could have being done differently. <br><br>
        Instead of starting with one note and then adding notes, we've could have started with the whole pattern add then substract notes. <br><br>
        We've could also have started with the last note of the seed as the first note of the pattern, and then add notes left of it.<br><br>
        Finally, we could have chosen to play the seed from right to left instead of left to right.<br><br>

        Because we have 3 different choices between 2 options, we can create \(2^3=8\) different patterns.<br><br>
        So, for the pattern A, we chose to: 
        <p>
Pattern A:<br>
1) Start with one note and then add notes.<br>
2) Start with the note at the extreme left and then add notes left of it.<br>
3) Play the seed from left to right. 
        </p>

        Let's now create all 8 possible patterns.
        <p>
Pattern B:<br>
1) Start with the whole seed and then substract notes.<br>
2) Substract notes from the right.<br>
3) Play the seed from left to right. 
        </p>

            <source src="audio/Pattern B.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

<p>
Pattern C:<br>
1) Start with one note and then add notes.<br>
2) Start with the note at the extreme left and then add notes left of it.<br>
3) Play the seed from right to left.
 </p>

        <img src="img/Pattern C.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern C.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

<p>
Pattern D:<br>
1) Start with the whole seed and then substract notes.<br>
2) Substract notes from the left.<br>
3) Play the seed from right to left.
</p>

        <img src="img/Pattern D.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern D.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>
<p>
Pattern E:<br>
1) Start with one note and then add notes.<br>
2) Start with the note at the extreme right and then add notes left of it.<br>
3) Play the seed from left to right.
</p>

        <img src="img/Pattern E.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern E.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>
<p>
Pattern F:<br>
1) Start with the whole seed and then substract notes.<br>
2) Substract notes from the left.<br>
3) Play the seed from left to right.
</p>

        <img src="img/Pattern F.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern F.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

<p>
Pattern G:<br>
1) Start with one note and then add notes.<br>
2) Start with the note at the extreme right and the add notes left of it.<br>
3) Play the seed from right to left.
</p>

        <img src="img/Pattern G.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern G.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>
<p>
Pattern H:<br>
1) Start with the whole seed and then substract notes.<br>
2) Substract notes from the right.<br>
3) Play the seed from right to left.
</p>

        <img src="img/Pattern H.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Pattern H.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>

        We can calculate the number of notes in each pattern with Gauss's formula:
        \(1+2+3+4+5+6+7\)\(= \sum_{i=1}^{7}i=7*8/2=28\)<br><br>
        We notice that Gauss's formula implies that the sum of numbers from 1 to 7, i.e. 28,
        has to be a multiple of 7. This will come useful later. <br> <br>

        Now, all of this will become pretty meta. We will reiterate the same process on the 8 patterns to create the 8 sections of the piece. <br><br>

        Let's take the pattern A. We first take the first note of the pattern, then the 2 first notes, then the 3 first notes etc. until we get all 28 notes of the pattern. 
        Doing so, we get the following result (this is just the beginning):<br><br>

        <img src="img/Section A.png" width="100%"><br>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Section A.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        </audio><br><br>
       
        Once the pattern is full, we then substract notes form it, starting from the left. Once there is no notes left, the section is over. <br> <br>

        So each section will have  \(1+2+3+4+...+27+28+27+\)\(...+3+2+1 =  \)\(\sum_{i=1}^{28}i+\sum_{i=1}^{27}i\)
        \(= 28*29/2+27*28/2\)\(= 406+378=784 \) notes. <br><br>

    We notice that \(784=28^2\). This is a specific case of the general assumption that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}i+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i=n^2\)<br>
    Indead, \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}i+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i\)\(=n(n+1)/2+(n-1)n/2\)\(= n/2((n+1)+(n-1)) \)\(= n/2*2n = n^2\) <br><br>

        Because \(784 = 28^2 = 4^2*7^2 = 16*49\), we can divide each section into 49 measures of 16 notes each. Because \(49=7^2\), we can 
        separate these 49 measures into 7 groups of 7 measures. <br> <br>

        So, the piece has 8 sections of 49 measures each, so \(8*49 = 392\) measures, and \(8*7=56\) groups of 7 measures.<br> <br>

        Let's now add lyrics to the piece. They will be separated into 8 groups of 7 lines each. The vocalist must say one line for each 
        measure. 

        <pre>

Group A: I THINK
THE COMBINATION
OF AGE
AND A  GREATER COMING TOGETHER
IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SPEED
OF THE PASSING TIME
________
Group B: ITâ€™S SIX MONTH NOW
AND I CAN TELL YOU
TRUTHFULLY
FEW PERIODS
IN MY LIFE
HAVE PASSED
SO QUICKLY
________
Group C: I
AM
IN
EXCELLENT
PHYSICAL
AND EMOTIONAL
HEALTH
________
Group D: THERE DOUBTLESS
SUBTLE
SURPRISES
AHEAD
BUT I FEEL
SECURE
AND READY
________
Group E: AS LOVERS
WILL CONTRAST
THEIR EMOTIONS
IN TIMES
OF CRISIS,
SO AM I DEALING
WITH MY ENVIRONMENT,
________
Group F: IN THE INDIFFERENT BRUTALITY,
THE INCESSANT NOISE,
THE EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY OF FOOD,
THE RAVINGS OF LOST HYSTERICAL MEN,
I CAN ACT
WITH CLARITY
AND MEANING
________
Group G: I AM DELIBERATE
SOMETIMES EVEN CALCULATING
SELDOM
EMPLOYING HISTRIONICS
EXCEPT AS A TEST
OF THE REACTIONS
OF OTHERS.
________
Group H: I READ MUCH,
EXERCISE,
TALK TO GUARD AND INMATE,
FEELING FOR
THE INEVITABLE
DIRECTION
OF MY LIFE

            As said previously, the piece has 56 groups in total. Because \(56=2*28\) and \(28=1+2+3+4+5+6+7\), 
            we can again use incrementation and decrementation as follows:

<pre>

A
AB
ABC
ABCD
ABCDE
ABCDEF
ABCDEFG
BCDEFGH
CDEFGH
DEFGH
EFGH
FGH
GH
H
</pre>

Regrouping 7 consecutive groups into one section, we get the following:

<pre>

Section A: AABABCA
Section B: BCDABCD
Section C: EABCDEF
Section D: ABCDEFG
Section E: BCDEFGH
Section F: CDEFGHD
Section G: EFGHEFG
Section H: HFGHGHH

That's what I call clever!<br><br>
